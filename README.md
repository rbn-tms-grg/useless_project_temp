# BananaVerse  🎯

## Basic Details
### Team Name: പഴംപൊരി

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Rebeen Thomas George - Mar Baselios Christian College of Engineering and Technology
- Member 2: Saffin M Varughese - Mar Baselios Christian College of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
We created a landing page that connects four delightfully useless yet entertaining mini‑apps:
- 🌱 A Judgmental Plant that roasts you for “caring” about it.
- 🍌 VazhaMoolyam™ that calculates your banana-based net worth.
- 🪐 An Interplanetary Weather Notifier for planets you’ll never visit.
- 🔮 A Yes/No Oracle that answers your serious questions with sarcastic simplicity.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Life is too predictable and serious. Nobody tells you how much money your parents could’ve made with bananas, how Saturn’s windstorms are doing, or whether your plant silently hates you.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a hub of sarcastic, bizarre, and slightly judgmental web apps to solve problems you never had:
- Get roasted by a digital plant.
- Discover your “true worth” in bananas.
- Stay updated on Pluto’s icy weather.
- Let the Yes/No Oracle decide your destiny.
